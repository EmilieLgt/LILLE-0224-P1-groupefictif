    <h2>Histoire</h2>
    <div class="history">
        <p>The band was originally founded by Johnny Silverhand and Kerry Eurodyne, though the group's name was
            coined by Nancy Hartley, inspired by fact that historical samurai were willing to die for their cause, even
            if it was immoral or just plain wrong. Samurai started as a back-street band, playing in various bars and
            clubs around Night City, such as the Palladium, Destiny, or Nexus. Their first gig ever was played at the
            Red Dirt bar. One night in 2003, after playing in the Rainbow Cadenza, the band was approached by a blitzed
            'dorpher', who turned out to be none other than Jack Masters, the head executive at Universal Music at the
            time. It took only three weeks for their first single, "Blistering Love," to achieve #1 hit on the
            EuroCharts, which soon
            they followed up with the album, being one of the few times a debut album achieved such status in such a
            short time.

            During the next years, Samurai toured around the world, playing concerts with an audience of
            thousands of people, even managing to sell out the whole Wembley Stadium. They released a total of six
            albums â€” with three being studio work, the other three being concerts and jam sessions. In early 2007, the
            band suffered a huge blow. Bel Isis was married. The rest of the band members didn't see it at first, but
            ten weeks after the
            ceremony they realized Bel's husband was mistreating her. One day, she finally got the courage to talk about
            it with the group after her husband tried to force her to quit Samurai. For Johnny and Kerry that
            was the last straw, but by the time they got there it was already too late. Bel's husband had started to
            beat her again, but then she threw him out of the window. Nancy was arrested, and after the
            trial was convicted to seven months of prison. During that timespan, the band firmly supported her. By
            2008, Nancy finally got out of jail. Unfortunately, those seven months of inactivity had put a split in the
            band that they were not able to heal. Soon afterwards, they all went on their separate
            ways. Henry went to work on a human interface prototype, but an accident fried his brain and he had to
            rebuild his mind. Denny joined a band called Mastermind, which went well for her. Nancy decided to change
            her name to Bes Isis, and became a major media presence on N54 News. Johnny and Kerry went on to
            have successful solo careers, usually touring together as a double ticket.

            In 2077, most of the original band got together to play a last gig in the Red Dirt bar, which almost a
            century later was still standing. </p>
